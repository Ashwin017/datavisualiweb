        <h2>Academic research in data visualisation</h2>
        
        <p>A research from Cornell University discovered that simply inserting a graph in an article particularly rises the temptation in users. <strong>While just 68% of users trusted a scientific declaration without a chart, an astounding 97% trusted that same declaration when a a diagram was incorporated.</strong> While their analysis inspected the influence in science specifically, it is not a difficult task to make bigger conclusions to news in general. The perfect lesson for visual writers is to include graphs to have more prominent influence with your readers.</p>

        <section>
        <p>The study from J.Heer, N.Kong and M.Agrawala on size effect, discovered that as graphs and charts become small, the readers' precision decreases. Nevertheless, while doing graphs taller rises precision, the effect will have a state of no change. The research show that there is an optimal graph that extend precision, which designers must think about along with the format of any given page. </p>
